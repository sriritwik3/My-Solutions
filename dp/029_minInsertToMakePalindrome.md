# Minimum insertions to make a string palindrome  
**[Link](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/minimum-insertions-to-make-string-palindrome-dp-29/)**  

## Solution  
Minimum Insertion required = n(length of the string) â€“ length of longest palindromic subsequence.  
Because if we keep the palindrome in the given string intact and only add the non palindromic characters correspondigly the final string would become palindrome.
